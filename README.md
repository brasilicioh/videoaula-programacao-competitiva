## 📘 About the Project

This repository was created as part of an academic activity proposed by professor **Alison Batista**.  
Our group decided to explore the topic **Competitive Programming** — a sport that challenges participants to solve algorithmic and logical problems efficiently using code.

The video lesson introduces the concept, history, and structure of competitive programming, presents some real competition problems, and demonstrates solutions in:

## 🧠 What is Competitive Programming?

**Competitive programming** is a mental sport where participants compete to solve algorithmic, logical, and mathematical problems as efficiently as possible.

Competitors receive several problem statements and must submit code that produces correct outputs for a set of test inputs — all under strict time and performance limits.  
Submissions are automatically evaluated, and points are awarded based on correctness and speed. The winner is the one who solves the most problems in the shortest time.

The sport encourages creativity, efficiency, and problem-solving skills, and is widely practiced in schools, universities, and online platforms around the world.

## 🏆 A Brief History

Competitive programming originated in the 1970s at **Texas A&M University**, where small problem-solving contests were organized among students.  
Over the following decades, it evolved into international competitions such as the **ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest)**, which has gathered teams from more than 80 countries since 2005.

In Brazil, the sport is promoted by the **Sociedade Brasileira de Computação (SBC)** through events like the **OBI (Olimpíada Brasileira de Informática)** and the **Maratona SBC de Programação**, which serves as the national selection for the ICPC.

## 💻 Problems Solved in the Video Lesson

During the video lesson, we solved and discussed the following problems:

| Problem | Source | Link |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Tomadas** | OBI 2013 – First Phase (Junior Level) | [olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/pratique/pj/2013/f1/tomadas/](https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/pratique/pj/2013/f1/tomadas/) |
| **Intervalo Distinto** | OBI 2023 – Second Phase (Level 2) | [OBI 2023 PDF](https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/static/extras/obi2023/provas/ProvaOBI2023_f2p2.pdf) |
| **Two Sum** | LeetCode | [leetcode.com/problems/two-sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/) |

Each problem was solved in **C**, **C++**, **Rust**, **Python** and **JavaScript** to illustrate how different languages can approach the same logic.

## 🌍 International and National Organizations

Competitive programming is supported by various global and national organizations that promote education, research, and innovation in computing:

- **ACM** – Association for Computing Machinery  
- **IEEE Computer Society** – Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  
- **IFIP** – International Federation for Information Processing  
- **SBC** – Sociedade Brasileira de Computação (Brazilian Computing Society)

These entities are responsible for organizing contests like **ICPC**, **IOI**, **OBI**, and **Maratona SBC**.

## 🧩 Platforms for Practice

Many online platforms help people train and compete in programming challenges:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/)

These platforms provide a wide range of problems, ranking systems, and contests that simulate real competitive programming environments.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Through this activity, we learned:
- What competitive programming is and how it works;
- How to analyze and solve algorithmic problems;
- The importance of efficiency in code design;
- How programming can be both a science and a sport.

Competitive programming develops logical, mathematical, and computational thinking — essential skills for any aspiring computer scientist or engineer.
